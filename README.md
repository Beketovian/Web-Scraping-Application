# Web-Scraping-Application

Learn the basics of web scraping, databases, GUI design and implementation, and learn to set up a message notification system primarily using Python. This is a learning-focused project so my primary focus will be to teach you the basics of everything mentioned before diving into the main project. Phase 1 and 2 will each take about 1-2 weeks. The rest of the time will be allocated to Phase 3.
